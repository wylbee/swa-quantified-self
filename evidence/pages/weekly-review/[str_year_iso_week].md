This week, my lights score was <Value data={weekly_tracks.filter(d => d.str_year_iso_week === $page.params.str_year_iso_week)} column=val_track_success/>%.

<BarChart 
    title='Lights'

For review, the following categories were in a dimmed state this week:

*Dimming categories*

{#each dimming_categories.filter(d => d.str_year_iso_week === $page.params.str_year_iso_week) as dc}

- **{dc.cat_habit_grouping}** - <Value data={dc} column=val_track_success/>%  

{/each}

*Dimming days*

{#each dimming_days.filter(d => d.str_year_iso_week === $page.params.str_year_iso_week) as dd}

- **{dd.str_track_dow}** - <Value data={dd} column=val_track_success/>%  

{/each}

*Dimming habits*

{#each dimming_habits.filter(d => d.str_year_iso_week === $page.params.str_year_iso_week) as hab}

- **{hab.str_habit_name}** - <Value data={hab} column=val_track_success/>%
